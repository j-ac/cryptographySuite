    EnigmaMachine():
    Ensure the user's requested number of rotors equals the actual
    Ensure all rotor types match the user's desired rotor type
    Ensure that the rotors that are generated use the correct seed.

    CreateLinkedListOfRotors():
        Ensure the first rotor has null as its previous
        Ensure the last rotor has null as its next
        Ensure all rotors have the first rotor assigned to their firstRotor attribute.

    PerformCypher()
        ensure single character messages can be encrypted
        ensure longer messages can be encrypted
        ensure messages with no spaces can be decrypted
        ensure messages with spaces can be decrypted
