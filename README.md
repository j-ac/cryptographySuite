Encryption/Decryption scripts

(one day) a series of scripts to encrypt/decrypt messages.

cypherWheel.py: Like a substitution cypher but stronger.  A series of wheels exist to give different options for substitutions, making brute forcing more difficult, and character mappings more difficult to decipher.
  
Enigma: A Java program which simulates the German Enigma machine used in WW2, famously cracked in part by Alan Turing.
When used, a series of prompts will configure the machine in the desired way, then a message can be encoded or decoded (The machine does not make a distinction between the two).
For the message to be decoded later, the machine will need to be configured in the same way as it was when the message was created.
